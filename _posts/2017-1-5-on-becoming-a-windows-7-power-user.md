## Why You Should Become a Windows 7 Power User

Windows 7 is gone and Windows 10 is here, right?  So why should you even be concerned with becoming a Windows 7 power user?  Well, I'm glad that you asked.  

Though Microsoft ended mainstream support for Windows 7 on January 13, 2015, many organizations still rely heavily on Windows 7 for their daily operations.  In fact, *most* organizations are still using Windows 7.  With the challenges associated with migrating an organization to a new OS, this isn't likely to change any time soon.  This makes taking the time to sharpen your Windows 7 skills a time-worthy investment.
